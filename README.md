# Axly - A Powerful Axios Wrapper for React and Node.js

Axly is an HTTP client library built on top of Axios that simplifies making HTTP requests with support for features such as:

- **Request and Response Interceptors** for custom processing
- **Token-based Authentication** via request headers
- **Retry Mechanisms** with configurable delays
- **Progress Tracking** for uploads and downloads
- **Cancellation** of pending requests
- **Custom Toast Notifications** on success or error events
- **Customizable Global and Per-Request Configuration**

Axly provides both a React hook for client-side development as well as a Node-friendly function for server-side applications.
